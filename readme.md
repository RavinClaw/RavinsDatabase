    Ravin's Database
This is a Datbase that I have created

    What can it do?
You can add anything to the database, numbers, letters

You can remove the information you have added

You can list the information, as in you can get the array number of your information

if, you are in the "list" command / area you must put in a 'string' otherwise the program will stop working

    What happens when you turn of the program
If you stop the repl the information you have put down will be deleted, (this will be updated soon though)

    What Imports does it use?
The Database as of current DOES NOT USE SQLAlchemy or Replit db

it only uses

import time | time.sleep(x)

import os | os.system('clear')
